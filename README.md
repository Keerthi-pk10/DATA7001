This project investigated Queensland's electricity market to examine the connections
between energy prices, energy demand, and weather temperature. Data on energy and
weather from five Australian states were analysed over a period of one year. By applying
regression analysis, the project identified significant factors affecting energy prices, with
noticeable changes in demand throughout the day and week. However, it found no
correlation between temperature and energy prices. The results could help energy
producers enhance their generation strategies, assist consumers in making better decisions,
and support policymakers in promoting sustainability and efficiency.
